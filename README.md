# Balanced-Regeneration
### This pack changes the health and hunger system, making it more interesting and strategic.

### Changes:
- Heal half a heart every eight seconds, draining half a hunger until full health, or at three hunger. 
- Eating will quickly heal you the amount of health the food is worth. Raw foods heal very little, cooked foods heal more, golden carrots will heal eight hearts but at a slower rate, and cooked steak and cooked pork are also very nutritious.
- Saturation is lowered, so you are able to eat more often.

This pack was inspired by [Stoo's Subtle Survival Improvements](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/stoo-s-subtle-survival-improvements-combat-health-mobs-recipes-exploration/), which is no longer updated. I used the pack [Custom Regeneraton](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/custom-regeneraton-controllable-regen/) as a base for this system.

If you have any feedback, bugs, or suggestions, please make an issue on Github! I would love to make this is good as it possibly can be!

**If you want to use this in your own pack or modify it, feel free to do so!**
